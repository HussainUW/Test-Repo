About This App:

What is this App?

This application is an open source project designed to create a simple productivity application that allows a user to create weekly todo lists. It was initially designed as a productivity system for ECE students at UW, and we have since adapted it as a React Based Web App.

Tech Stack

This App uses Postgresql to store and relate user data on the backend. The Database is queried using a restful API that we wrote to make a number of requests to access and store user data.  API was developed in JavaScript using Node.js and Express elements. The front-end application is developed primarily using React with the entire project being deployed over a Heroku server.
